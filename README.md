> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might notice that all the code/configs are gone. This is because I'm doing a complete refactor, as well as switching to using [`Quickshell`](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/) for the widgets.
> If you would like to read the old code, browse the branches.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is very young, and the code may be refactored without notice.
